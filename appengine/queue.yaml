# For processing archival data, we want to be able to process roughly one month
# per day, which for current data rates of 1 million tests per day, is
# about 30 million rows per day, or about 350 rows/second.
#
# BigQuery has a streaming insert quota per table.  The published quota is
# 100MB/sec per table, but we have been hitting the quota at seemingly
# lower rates - around 200 rows/second for NDT, which is about 20MB/sec of
# data in the final table.
# Not clear what is going on - perhaps the quota is on the size of incoming
# HTTP request data - but we will design to stay well within 200
# rows/second limit.
#
# When reprocessing data older than 30 days, the pipeline inserts rows 
# into templated tables, which means there is a separate table per day.
# So for archive reprocessing more than 30 days in the past, the BQ quota
# ends up being rows/sec per day/date.
#
# Let's choose a conservative BQ rate limit of 200 rows/second, per
# table, and therefore per archive date.
#
# The new scraper produces about 16K tasks per day, with about 60 row inserts
# per task.  But older archives are much larger, with perhaps 1000 to 2000 tar
# files per day, and 600 to 1000 tests per file.
# 
# The individual tasks in the new pipeline complete in roughly 45 seconds,
# so the net row insert rate is around 1.3 rows/sec per task, at least
# when instances are running at modest CPU load of 60% or so.  (The
# throughput per task drops when CPU utilization exceeds 90% or so).
#
# Using task queue rate/sec, we would have to very conservative because
# of the very large older archives. But by limiting the rate based on
# number of concurrent tasks, we can regulate the throughput independent
# of the size of the archive files.  200 rows/second, divided by 1.3 rows/sec
# per task, results in a target of roughly 150 concurrent tasks per archive date.
#
# To reach the desired 350 rows/second required to process one month's
# data each day, we need to process at least 2 days of data in parallel.
# The quota gaurantee comes from putting any one day's data into a single
# task queue, and the desired aggregate throughput can be achieved by
# having multiple queues, and spraying different days across different
# queues.
#
# To make things conceptually simple, we will just create queues with
# suffixes like -0, -1, -2 ...
# A corresponding batch reprocessing script will use Gregorian ordinal
# of the date, mod N, to determine which queue to drop any given date
# into.  We just choose an appropriate N that gives us the throughput
# we need.  For now, N=8 gives us a bit of headroom, so this config
# sets up -0 through -4.
#
# The current pipeline config has up to 40 instances with 2 cpus and
# 12 workers each.  This could handle up to 0.9 * 40 * 12 or 432
# concurrent tasks, which is well in excess of what we currently need.
# Some adjustments may be needed once this is running regularly.
#
# SUMMARY:
# 1. Each queue must limit concurrent requests to about 55 to limit
#    rate into individual tables to around 200 rows/second.
# 2. We have 8 queues, to allow up to about 1600 rows/second, to
#    allow 30 days of data to be processed within one day, with
#    some headroom for future growth.
