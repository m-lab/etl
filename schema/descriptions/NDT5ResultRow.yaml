    include JSON, TLV.
Control.ClientMetadata:
  Description: Client-reported metadata as name/value pairs.
Control.ClientMetadata.Name:
  Description: If set, contains text that identifies and provides context for the corresponding metadata value. For example, "OS" or "clientApplication"
Control.ClientMetadata.Value:
  Description: If set, contains a value corresponding to metadata name. For example, "Windows 10" or "ndtJS"

C2S:
  Description: Metadata for Client-to-Server (upload) measurements performed using the ndt5 protocol.
