resources:
  cpu: 2
  # Instances support between [(cpu * 0.9) - 0.4, (cpu * 6.5) - 0.4]
  # Actual memory available is exposed via GAE_MEMORY_MB environment variable.
  # even though the parser has extremely limited RAM requirements, the
  # minimum RAM assignable to 2 CPUs is around 1.5GB
  # We see some OOMs at 3 GB (in etl-batch-parser), so let's try 6

  # We expect fairly steady load, so a modest minimum will rarely cost us anything.
