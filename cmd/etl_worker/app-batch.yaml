# TODO(dev): adjust CPU and memory based on actual requirements.
resources:
  cpu: 2
  # Instances support between [(cpu * 0.9) - 0.4, (cpu * 6.5) - 0.4]

automatic_scaling:
  # This is intended for batch jobs.  A single instance is required, and we allow
  # it to scale up to 40 instances to get work done quickly.  However, note that
  # more than 3 tasks/sec may result in bigquery stream quota problems, so this
  # may require changes.
  min_num_instances: 10  # Too small a number here, and error rate prevents auto-scaling
  max_num_instances: 40
  # Very long cool down period, to reduce the likelihood of tasks being truncated.

  # We don't care much about latency, so a high utilization is desireable.
