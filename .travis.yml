# Travis configuration for etl-worker.
#
# etl-worker is a Go project supporting release automation to mlab-sandbox
# for a single branch in the m-lab/etl repository. The steps it takes are:
#
#  * decrypt service account credentials
#  * install the Google Cloud SDK command line tools (gcloud)
#  * cache the gcloud installation and setup
#  * test and build the go code
#  * on success, deploy the result when the origin branch matches a supported
#    deployment target.
#
# NOTE: Cloud functions only support primitive IAM roles: Owner, Editor, Viewer.
# See: https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/iam
# TODO(soltesz): Add deployment automation when fine-grained permissions are
# possible.
