# Travis configuration for etl-worker.
#
# etl-worker is a Go project supporting release automation to mlab-sandbox
# for a single branch in the m-lab/etl repository. The steps it takes are:
#
#  * decrypt service account credentials
#  * install the Google Cloud SDK command line tools (gcloud)
#  * cache the gcloud installation and setup
#  * test and build the go code
#  * on success, deploy the result when the origin branch matches a supported
#    deployment target.

- go get github.com/mattn/goveralls
- go get github.com/wadey/gocovmerge

# NB: Encrypted values are not defined in forks or pull requests.
# Decrypt the tar archive containing the GCP service account key files.
#
# After unpacking, there should be one service account key file for every GCP
# project referenced in the "deploy" section. These keys authenticate the
# gcloud deploy operations.
